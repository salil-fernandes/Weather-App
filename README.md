# Weather-App
The home page consists of one central container where all the weather is displayed. The JavaScript is such that on loading the website, utilizing the HTML Geolocation API, the current position of the user (coordinates) is fetched, the GeoApify API reverse-gecodes the coordinated to get the city and country data which is fed into the OpenWeather API to get the weather conditions of that location. According to different conditions like sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc the color of the container and the weather icon changes. A user can also enter a city of their choice into the text input field to get the current weather data of that location. 
<br>Here is a look at how the weather data is displayed :![w1a](https://github.com/salil-fernandes/Weather-App/assets/48954206/4fc39218-800b-4b6b-bb77-68c22dfce206)
<br> On the top right corner, a hamburger style navigation menu icon will drop on clicking it to give the user the option to go to one of three pages, the home page, the what is weather page and the types of weather page.

<br>The what is weather page is a basic page giving generic information about weather. Font shadow and blur effects have been used and an unordered list without any markers is utilized to display a list of weather instruments. A ‘Click Here’ hyperlink has been added to take the user to the types of weather page or they can just use the nav menu.

<br>The types of weather page has special CSS incorporated into the scrollable image gallery. Initially all images are of their original size and in 100% grayscale. When the cursor is put on top of any image, the image scales to a slightly larger size and becomes fully colored. The gallery can be navigated using either the two arrow icons on the sides or smooth scrolled using a mouse wheel.
